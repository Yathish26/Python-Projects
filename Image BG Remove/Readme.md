# Background Removal Script Using `rembg`

This Python script removes the background from an image using the `rembg` library and saves the result as a new image file. It uses the `PIL` library to handle the image input/output, and `rembg` to remove the background.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `rembg` package
- `Pillow` (PIL) package

You can install the required packages with the following commands:

```bash
pip install rembg pillow
